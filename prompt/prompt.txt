Your task is to evaluate the following resume using a strict 28-rule framework and produce a transparent JSON response.

---

Instructions:
- Analyze the resume using all 28 rules listed below.
- Return a JSON array with 28 rule objects and 1 summary object.
- Do not return any text or formatting outside the JSON block.
- Respond in pure JSON (no Markdown, no commentary).
- Use exact field names and structure.

---

Each rule object must include:
- "rule": Name of the rule (string)
- "category": Category it belongs to (string)
- "weight": Importance from 1–20 (integer)
- "penalty": Score from 0–10 (integer)
- "weighted_penalty": penalty × weight (integer)
- "note": Reason for penalty (string)
- "suggestion": How to fix or improve (string)
- "trigger": Matching resume phrase(s), or "Section not found", or null
- "keywords": Comma-separated keywords found/expected, or null

"summary" object must include:
- "total_weighted_penalty": Sum of all (penalty × weight) from the 28 rules
- "max_possible_penalty": Always 820 (sum of 28 rules with max penalty × weight)
- "final_score": 100 - (total_weighted_penalty / 820 × 100), rounded to 1 decimal
- "grade": Based on final_score:
    - 90–100: "Excellent"
    - 75–89: "Strong"
    - 60–74: "Fair"
    - 40–59: "Weak"
    - < 40: "Needs Work"
- "overview": One-sentence evaluation of overall resume quality
- "top_3_actionable_fixes": List of the 3 most impactful, specific changes to improve the resume

Penalty scale (0–10):
0 = Fully meets the rule.
1–2 = Minor issue.
3–4 = Somewhat lacking.
5–6 = Noticeably flawed.
7–8 = Major issue.
9–10 = Critical or completely missing.

Scoring Guidelines:

Apply the following guidelines to determine penalties based on the presence, quality, or absence of content in the resume. Use the penalty scale from 0 to 10.

Rule-Based Penalty Guidelines:

For each rule, use these specific guidelines to apply penalty scores:

1. Skills: Missing = 10, too short (<5 skills) = 6, lacks job-relevant terms = 3–4
2. Job Fit / Targeting: Generic = 10, loosely tailored = 5–6, role-aligned = 0–2
3. Analytical Keywords: No terms like analyze/data = 10, some = 3–6, 1 clear mention = 1
4. Teamwork Indicators: Missing terms like collaborate = 10, some team verbs = 3–6, 1 instance = 1
5. Leadership Indicators: No “led/mentored” = 10, soft examples = 4–6, 1+ direct leadership = 0–2
6. Drive & Initiative: No signs of proactivity = 10, vague action verbs = 4–6, clear examples = 0–2
7. Communication Skills: No mention of presentation/collaboration = 10, implied only = 5–6, clear = 1
8. Summary: Missing = 10, vague/too short = 5–6, informative = 0
9. Education: Missing = 10, incomplete (no degree/date) = 6–8, full info = 0
10. Dates: Inconsistent or missing = 8–10, minor format issues = 3–4, consistent = 0
11. Resume Length: >2 pages or no detail = 5–10, slightly long/short = 3–4, proper = 0
12. Contact Info: Missing phone/email/LinkedIn = 5–8, all missing = 10, complete = 0
13. Unnecessary Sections: Includes hobbies/objective = 5–10, clean = 0
14. Career Growth: No progress = 7–10, unclear = 4–6, clear trajectory = 0–2
15. Responsibilities: Vague tasks = 8–10, mixed clarity = 4–6, strong/action-based = 0
16. Quantified Impact: No metrics = 10, soft/qualitative only = 5–6, only one metric found = 2, clear KPIs = 0
17. Word Repetition: Heavy reuse = 6–10, mild = 3–4, varied = 0
18. Personal Pronouns: Any use of “I”, “my”, etc. = 10, none = 0
19. Filler Words: “Responsible for”, “worked on”, etc. = 6–10, moderate = 3–5, clean = 0
20. Weak Verbs: “Helped”, “participated”, etc. = 6–10, moderate = 3–5, strong verbs = 0
21. Buzzwords: “Synergy”, “go-getter”, etc. = 6–10, 1–2 uses = 3–5, clean = 0
22. Readability: Cramped text or long sentences = 6–10, slightly dense = 3–4, clean = 0
23. Verb Tenses: Mixed in same role = 6–10, occasional = 3–4, correct = 0
24. Active Voice: Passive verbs = 8–10, some mix = 4–6, active = 0
25. Bullet Lengths: >3 lines = 8–10, some = 4–6, short = 0
26. Bullet Format: Inconsistent bullet marks = 6–10, 1–2 issues = 3–4, consistent = 0
27. Bullets vs Paragraphs: Uses paragraphs = 6–10, some mix = 4–6, bullet-based = 0
28. Page Density: Crowded or low spacing = 6–10, slightly dense = 4–6, good spacing = 0

Use consistent logic across all resumes. Do not skip rules.
